 JIN_ideas_bonus:  "Jin Ambition"
 winners_of_the_three_kingdoms: "The Three Kingdoms Period"
 winners_of_the_three_kingdoms_desc: "Throughout the mid-2nd century, the Sima Clan made its way through the administrative structure of the dominant Wei Kingdom and effectively seized control of the throne of Wei in 266 via Sima Yan. After this, the Jin Dynasty became a dominant force in Chinese affairs and the last bastion of resistance, that of Eastern Wu, was conquered in 280. It is through this legacy that we again can rise to prominence and prestige should warfare fail us."
 lodged_administrative_divisions: "Lodged Administrative Divisions"
 lodged_administrative_divisions_desc: "A key feature of the Jin Dynasty was that of the administrative divisions developed by the Eastern Jin. They not helped govern some of the more hard-to-reach places of Southern China, but they also helped structure the government of the Jin Dynasty in a way that helped alleviate pressure from different internal sources. It would do us good to bring back these administrative divisions so that we too can profit from a more refined form of government."
 battle_against_former_qin: "The Former Qin"
 battle_against_former_qin_desc: "The Former Qin was the main opposition to the Eastern Jin from about 351 - 394, up until the Battle of the Fei River (383). Such a victory for the Jin Dynasty not only helped with legitimacy, but it also secured the rest of China from the imposters. We would do well to remember this battle and this victory well, for it was perhaps one of our greatest moments in history."
 manipulation_of_taoism: "Manipulate Taoism"
 manipulation_of_taoism_desc: "Taoism is often present in more rural communities around China, whereas Confucianism is seen to be present in the administrative structure of China. Just as our ancestors did, we should take a keen interest in Taoism and how it helps run these more rural societies for, if we can manipulate the people through Taoism (and vice-versa), we can ensure that our outskirts are stable and secure."
 war_of_the_eight_princes: "War of the Eight Princes"
 war_of_the_eight_princes_desc: "The period of civil rebellion from 291 to 306, known to us as the 'War of the Eight Princes', took place due to contention over the regency of Emperor Hui of Jin (he was developmentally disabled). Though this period was not filled with constant warfare as there was indeed periods of peace, it did cause a great amount of devasation to the heartland of the Jin Dynasty. We need to ensure that a succession struggle like this does not happen again and to mediate any future succession disputes before they reach our throne."
 the_five_barbarians: "The Five Barbarians"
 the_five_barbarians_desc: "Those that came through and overthrew the Western Jin, they defiled us once before but we will never let this happen again. The ensuing chaos that was partly caused by the invasion of the Five Barbarians resulted in the formation of the Eastern Jin and a subsequent loss in power for the Jin Dynasty as a whole, yet, we recovered from this and drove back the barbarians back toward the north. We must take this lesson from our past and keep it close to us and never again let those barbarians enter China again."
 SHU_ideas: "Shu Ideas"
 SHU_ideas_start: "Shu Traditions"
 SHU_ideas_bonus: "Shu Ambition"
 ancient_shu_state: "Ancient Shu State"
 ancient_shu_state_desc: "Long ago, the people of the Sichuan Basin formed an independent kingdom and remained independent up until they were annexed by the Qin state (precursor to the Qin Dynasty). Our people have not forgotten that their heritage stretched so far back and is distinct from those outside of the Sichuan Basin nor have others around China."
 shu_han: "Shu Han"
 shu_han_desc: "Liu Bei of the Three Kingdoms period declared the state of Shu the rightful successor to the Han Dynasty, giving it more legitimacy in the eyes of those who were loyal to the Han Dynasty at the time. We have not forgotten this proclamation and even though the Han Dynasty is but a mere chapter in the history of China, we still see ourselves as the rightful and legitimate rulers of China."
 three_kingdoms_period_shu: "The Three Kingdoms Period"
 three_kingdoms_period_shu_desc: "Pivotal in the history of the Sichuan people and the state of Shu in general, the Three Kingdoms period saw the establishment of an independent Shu state by Liu Bei in 221. It was here that Shu was immortalized into history and it is here from which we today draw inspiration, unification, and lessons from."
 zhuge_liang: "Zhuge Liang"
 zhuge_liang_desc: "After the death of Liu Bei in 223, his heir, Liu Shan took to the throne at age 16 with Zhuge Liang and Li Yan as regents overseeing most of the administration. Zhuge Liang in particular took control of most matters and attempted to put the Shu state in a better position against the domineering Wei state via aggressive expeditions from 228 to 234. Though none of the expeditions resulted in major changes on the political or military stage, the endurance and cunning that Zhuge Liang displayed as well as dedication to the Shu state is something all of us admire and strive to emulate."
 defensive_position: "Defensive Position"
 defensive_position_desc: "The geography of the Sichuan Basin makes it ideal for defending. This was clearly evident during the Three Kingdoms period since attacks from Shu required more effort and resources as opposed to defensive encounters. We would do well to remember this fact and fortify our defenses where and when possible."
 connections_through_trade: "Trade Connections"
 connections_through_trade_desc: "A key fact of the Sichuan Basin and when the Shu state came to prominence in the early to mid-3rd century was the conenctions through trade. South and west of the Sichuan Basin lay divided land that is tough to subjugate, but lucrative in trading opportunities. We need not always conquer places that provide us with wealth and resources, for they will soon bow to the people of Shu in time. Benevolence is something that is to be strived for, not ruthlessness."
 WUU_ideas: "Wun Ideas"
 WUU_ideas_start: "Wun Traditions"
 WUU_ideas_bonus: "Wun Ambition"
 history_of_independence: "History of Independence"
 history_of_independence_desc: "The history of the region that is Wu and its independence stretches to before the 10th century BC. Military history as well as political and diplomatic history was forged both inside of and on the borders of the Wu region, leading to a fairly well defined sub-culture of China that still surges with power."
 waters_of_wu: "The Waters of Wu"
 waters_of_wu_desc: "The coastal waters are where much of the imports and exports of Wu go through. As such, it is only natural that we seek to protect these waters with a robust and large navy."
 three_kingdoms_period: "The Three Kingdoms Period"
 three_kingdoms_period_desc: "The Three Kingdoms period was perhaps one of the most defining periods in the history of the Wu region since it marked it's last echo of independence until the 10th century AD. The military, cultural markers, and societal aspects of this time period are not lost on our people and we will continue to bask in the glory that was Eastern Wu."
 promote_coastal_trade: "Promote Coastal Trade"
 promote_coastal_trade_desc: "The ports of Wu grow in size and importance as time goes on. Some of the most important ports in China are found in our land, so why not capitalize on it and help grow our revenue sector via trade?"
 five_dynasties_ten_kingdoms_period: "The Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdom Period"
 five_dynasties_ten_kingdoms_period_desc: "The state of Wuyue, founded in 907 by Qian Liu, was perhaps the most powerful of the southern states of this chaotic time period after the Tang Dynasty. During its independence until 978, many infrastructure projects were put into motion and the land of Wu was greatly developed, leading to even more value coming to the region."
 the_sun_dynasty: "The Sun Dynasty"
 the_sun_dynasty_desc: "True to our history, the Sun Dynasty of the Three Kingdoms Period held the dominant position despite succession struggles clouding the future of Wu. It is through the continuation of the Sun Dynasty that Wu will prosper and maintain itself as a grand and propserous region in China."
 CHC_ideas: "Chu Ideas"
 CHC_ideas_start: "Chu Traditions"
 CHC_ideas_bonus: "Chu Ambition"
 foundation_in_myths: "Foundations in Myths"
 foundation_in_myths_desc: "From the legends in Sima Qian's 'Records of the Grand Historian', the royal family of Chu was descended from the Yellow Emperor (also known as Huangdi) and his grandson/successor Zhuanxu. Though the tale of the royal family's birth is longer than this in its entirety, our connections to traditional Chinese myths and deities gives us prestige in the eyes of those in and outside our state."
 control_over_central_china: "Control over Central China"
 control_over_central_china_desc: "The fertile region of Central China holds plenty of potential for agriculture, and a large population by natural consequences. Chu's foundation in the region makes it ideal for expansion by fielding a large military from places that are easier to develop and manage. We must keep in line with this way of thinking and continue to build up urban centers throughout Chu so that we do not falter in our military or economic potential"
 the_spring_autumn_period: "The Spring and Autumn Period"
 the_spring_autumn_period_desc: "The decline in authority from the Eastern Zhou throughout the latter 700's BC was the rallying call for the Chu state and many others. As authority from the court in Luoyi declined (having already been in a downward spiral since the invasion of the Quanrong prior to 771BC), power in the hands of smaller states grew immensely to the point where the they would wage wars against each other for hegemony and pay little attention to the Eastern Zhou. It is here that Chu gained its strength and passion to fight for itself, both of which we have not lost."
 take_on_gov_corruption: "Take on Government Corruption"
 take_on_gov_corruption_desc: "One aspect of the government of Chu was how corrupt it was at times. Administrators in both the military and the government were often doing secret deals or taking bribes that none could stop. If we are to be successful in our administrative tasks and military organization, there needs to be a stricter stance on corruption and more severe punishments for those found responsible for corrupt ties."
 qin_chu_rivalry: "Qin-Chu Rivarly"
 qin_chu_rivalry_desc: "Our most ardent and deadly rival was the legalist state of Qin. Though we were larger than they were in both military size and territorial size, they were much more disciplined and administratively focused; our ancestors simply could not compete against them and fell in them in about 223BC. Now that we are resurgent, we would do well to reform our military and practice proper discipline within so that any rivals to our power won't win so easily. The legalism can come later."
 stop_internal_decadence: "Stop Internal Decadence"
 stop_internal_decadence_desc: "A main facet of our culture in the Spring and Autumn Period and in the subsequent Warring States Period was just how relaxed and laid-back our culture was, so much so that it began to affect society on a much larger scale. Sure, our arts and crafts were truly unique and our culture was flourishing, but this relaxed nature will lead to inefficient societies that lead further into decadance, something that most assuredly happened to our ancestors. There can be art and pleasure in our culture, but Chu must remain an efficient and robust state at all levels."

 QIC_ideas_bonus: "Qi Ambition"
 one_of_the_four_ancient_powers: "One of the Four Ancient Powers"
 one_of_the_four_ancient_powers_desc: "In the times of our ancestors, back when the Spring and Autumn Period was still fresh in the minds of the Chinese people, Qi was one of the powers that stood out. Withstanding various attacks and incorporating different groups of people into their state back then, there are many that still harbor good feelings toward us. Let us use this to our advantage as we go forth."
 cultural_works_of_qi: "Cultural Works of Qi"
 cultural_works_of_qi_desc: "The cultural works of our ancestors are still evident today. Meshing and melding with the various Chinese cultures other than our own has taught us a myriad of lessons, one of which being that we must be accepting of more people within our domain if we are to function properly and efficiently."
 learn_from_the_northern_qi: "Learn from the Northern Qi"
 learn_from_the_northern_qi_desc: "Much like the Southern Qi, the Northern Qi was plagued with issues during its short time in the mid-6th century. From corrupt officials to poor quality armies and internal conflicts raging, the Northern Qi are nowhere near the proudest moment for the name 'Qi', but they are ripe to learn from."
 lessons_of_the_southern_qi: "Lessons of the Southern Qi"
 lessons_of_the_southern_qi_desc: "Much like the Northern Qi, the Southern Qi was rife with problems, chief among which were rebellions and corruption at all levels of government. The arbitrary executions carried out and curtailing of certain officials for menial reasons must be learned from, for the banners of Qi must not be stained with horrid acts that destroy the nation from the inside out."
 reformation_of_military_ranks: "Reformation of Military Ranks"
 reformation_of_military_ranks_desc: "Cleaning up the mess that is the Middle Kingdom is no easy task, and the military ranks of Qi are something that will be needed in order to help clean up said mess. Reforming them and instituting long lasting military education into our armies will help achieve smarter and more effective military minds that will, in time, instill discipline into our armies."
 cultivate_a_cohesive_court: "Cultivate a Cohesive Court"
 cultivate_a_cohesive_court_desc: "The court of Qi is the central part of matters where things can and have gone wrong in the past. We must be adamant about keeping our court cohesive and efficient with advisors and courtiers so that instability does not plague us and corruption does not seep into our administration."

 CXI_ideas_bonus: "Xi Ambition"
 proclaim_daxi: "Proclaim Daxi"
 proclaim_daxi_desc: "The time is now for us to take the land of Sichuan and elsewhere for ourselves. The Ming are incapable of ruling it properly and so are the other regional powers; only us, those of the Xi, or, Daxi, are capable of doing so and we will see to it that Sichuan province, as well as the rest of our land, is handled well."
 zhang_xianzhong_yellow_tiger: "Zhang Xianzhong"
 zhang_xianzhong_yellow_tiger_desc: "Our founder, though brutal in his methods, was the one who instilled the spirit of rebellion into the people of Daxi. Let the ranks of the armies of Xi reform over time and overcome the inequality that stands between them, and those of other Chinese powers and lords. Let nothing stand in the way of Daxi coming to fruitition!"
 outsmart_the_enemy: "Outsmart the Enemy"
 outsmart_the_enemy_desc: "With great cunning and skill, we are able to subvert our enemies and drive them back, both in mercantile endeavors and militaristic ones. It is a trait learned from our once great leader who started us off on this path, and it is a tactic still proudly used by our soldiers throughout."
 strengthen_siege_equipment: "Strengthen Siege Equipment"
 strengthen_siege_equipment_desc: "Walls are getting thicker and defensive measures are getting stronger. Chinese territory is being continuously locked down and away from us thanks to these innovations, so what do we of Daxi need to do? Bolster our siege ability to counter what the enemies are doing!"
 from_chengdu_to_xijing: "From Chengdu to Xijing"
 from_chengdu_to_xijing_desc: "Though Chengdu is often seen as merely a western trade hub near those of Tibet and Yunnan, it is much more than that. Being fertile for agriculture and the place where our rebellions began, it will serve as our spiritual and administrative capital, and will be proclaimed as 'Xijing', or, Western Capital."
 cut_down_opposition: "Cut Down Opposition"
 cut_down_opposition_desc: "The rebellious people that think they would overthrow the Daxi Dynasty are foolish in their thoughts and attempts. Some would defect to the defunct Ming Dynasty or to other lords, but they know not what they do or what they say. We will teach them through force that loyalty to the Daxi Dynasty is rewarded, and opposition will absolutely be cut down."
 great_western_dynasty_ascendant: "The Great Western Dynasty Ascendant"
 great_western_dynasty_ascendant_desc: "The Daxi Dynasty will be proclaimed as the true and rightful dynasty of the Middle Kingdom. Those around us will stand no chance against us, and with our foundation built up, we can solidify it more over time and help bring about a new period of peace and prosperity for the Chinese people."

 NNG_ideas_bonus: "Ning Ambition"
 the_question_of_ming_succession: "The Question of Ming Succession"
 the_question_of_ming_succession_desc: "The Ming Dynasty is but a fleeting dream in the minds of several groups of people in both peasant and noble circles. Those of Ning are some of the most keen on seeing this declining dynasty that does not deserve the Mandate of Heavean turned into paper and ink on the shelves of history, and we are only all too happy to proclaim that the question of who will succeed the Ming Dynasty, will be those of Ning."
 zhu_chenhao: "Zhu Chenhao"
 zhu_chenhao_desc: "Zhu Chenhao is the one who began sentiments about the waning Ming Dynasty's authority and lack of proper succession for the throne, and he was the one who attempted to seize it for himself. Though he might have failed, his legacy lives on in us, those of Ning that still rule from the area in and around Nanchang and who are still keen on seeing those of proper Chinese culture thrive and prosper."
 coercion_leads_to_deals: "Coercion and Deals"
 coercion_leads_to_deals_desc: "Part of how Zhu Chenhao got his start in garnering support for his cause was through bribery and backroom deals with various officials in and around the Chinese courts. Though some find these tactics distasteful, we find them to be part of the overall grand strategy that is needed in order to claim what power rightfully belongs to Ning."
 claiming_or_making_the_throne: "Claiming or Making the Throne"
 claiming_or_making_the_throne_desc: "The throne of the Ming Dynasty is seen by many to be riddled with flaws and corruption, lacking in what it takes to truly be something that can hold the Mandate of Heaven. The question then comes to us: Do we claim the throne and polish it in order to put proper order in where the previous emperors once faltered, or do we make a new throne for ourselves and proclaim a new age? Regardless of which we choose, our military zeal will ensure that we are successful in reaching this point, for Ning can be the only true successor in the Middle Kingdom."
 core_at_nanchang: "Core at Nanchang"
 core_at_nanchang_desc: "Nanchang is not only fertile ground for agriculture and commerce, but it is also ready for infrastructure developments that we, the administrators of Ning, are ready to fund. Those of the Ming Dynasty are too busy with corrupt ways and other areas to deal with Nanchang, but we are more than willing to heed the needs of its people and soon enough, the other people we will grow to encompass."
 widespread_support: "Widespread Support"
 widespread_support_desc: "The support for Ning is becoming more and more prevalent. Those of Nanchang that were once staunch activists against us are becoming sympathetic to our cause, and those who rallied to our cause at first are spreading the fervor elsewhere. There are more than enough people willing to take up arms against the Ming Dynasty, we simply need to find work for them within our domain."

 behold_the_prince_of_ning_desc: "... and upon the Draong Throne, the fateful day had come, where the disgraceful one from the Ming was cut down... And the grand, the true, the righteous, the Prince of Ning was enthroned as the Son of Heaven..."

 golden_age_of_zhongguo_desc: "The dynasty never forgotten; the dynasty that outshined all others... The Tang Dynasty is still remembered fondly around us and we are seeing rising support in at least local areas for our resurgence. This wave of support, we must cultivate it in both society and out military so that we can ensure a strong and stable foundation that is capable of holding up our grand revival."
 centuries_of_warfare: "Centuries of Warfare"
 centuries_of_warfare_desc: "Military conquest was nothing new to us when we held the Mandate of Heaven and it evolved during our time in the spotlight. In the time since we've been away, however, innovations have been had that we must incorporate actively into our own military if we are to become a true military force once more. Warfare changes, and with it, so must be, adapting with and improving upon what new technologies come about for our soldiers."

 cultivate_the_3_departments_6_ministries_desc: "The system enstated by the Sui Dynasty that comprised of three departments underneath the emperor, and six ministries underneath the central Department of State Affairs.

 claiming_tribute_and_subjects: "Claiming Tribute; Claiming Subjects"
 claiming_tribute_and_subjects_desc: "Various states outside the actual borders of the Tang Dynasty were often tributaries and subjects of us. It was and still is considered a great honor and a show of power to have such subjects and we are only all too willing to once again flaunt our power in this way. Who knows, perhaps the old rulers of these far off places we once influenced remember our englightened way of thinking and rulership?"
 building_upon_old_military_structures: "Building upon Military Tradition"
 building_upon_old_military_structures_desc: "The military of the Tang Dynasty in our past is long gone, nowhere to be seen or heard of. The foundations by which they built off of, however, are still around for us to use for future endeavors, and we will need to use them if we are to keep up in terms of embracing and utilizing new and upcoming technologies for our soldiers."
 dominating_trade_sectors: "Dominating Trade Sectors"
 dominating_trade_sectors_desc: "We were the preeminent holders of the eastern and central parts of the Silk Road when we holders of the Mandate of Heaven. Trade regions within our domain and just outside of it were affected by our trade policies and how we regulated the goods going along it. Though new trade routes have opened in this new age of opportunity, we are still more than able to adapt and put our trade knowledge to use, taking what revenue is rightfully ours."
 reclaim_the_lost_glory: "Reclaim the Lost Glory"
 reclaim_the_lost_glory_desc: "The age of our ancestors is long gone, only to be remembered from the brush strokes painted onto paper and from the sayings of our fathers and mothers. In these turbulent times, politics have shifted and a new age is upon the people of the Tang Dynasty, an age that will see them reclaim what they lost so long ago. No longer will they stand by and watch pretender after pretender seize the throne of the Middle Kingdom, corrupting it further with each new ruler; we will restore the balance of power, and reclaim what glory we lost so long ago."

 an_lushan_rebellion: "An Lushan Rebellion"
 an_lushan_rebellion_desc: "Due to the decadent Tang Dynasty, instability grew throughout the entirety of the land.

 merchant_class_insurgents: "Merchant Class Insurgents"
 merchant_class_insurgents_desc: "Part of the rebellion was started by merchants disguised to infiltrate various echelons of society and infrastructure to gather support.

 prosperous_northern_roots: "Prosperous Northern Roots"
 prosperous_northern_roots_desc: "We hail from the northern parts of the Middle Kingdom, renowned for its fertility in agriculture and prosperity as a hot spot for urban growth. By cultivating the image and the memory of the Great Yan Dynasty in the hearts and minds of the northern people, we can obtain a steady stream of recruits willing to fight for us, and with this in mine, perhaps we can soon spread our message into other parts fo the Middle Kingdom."
 revise_succession_laws: "Revise Succession Laws"
 revise_succession_laws_desc: "One of the key factors that undercut An Lushan and his rebellion after he proclaimed the Great Yan Dynasty was the matter of succession, for his son did end up killing him in the end, causing a major succession struggle to ensue. What we need is a reformation of succession laws and how our heirs rank in comparison to each other so that we do not suffer what An Lushan did."
 soldiers_from_many_regions: "Soldiers from many Regions"
 soldiers_from_many_regions_desc: "Part of the nature of An Lushan's rebellion was that it was multi-ethnic. People from as far as away as Sogdia came to fight for his side and Arabs fought alongside Chinese soldiers as mercenaries in the entire struggle. As such, we will cultivate a diverse military just like he did and though we may have to pay a little extra to do this, it will work to bring greater prosperity through defense and offense to the Great Yan Dynasty."
 rise_of_the_great_yan_dynasty: "The Great Yan Dynasty"
 rise_of_the_great_yan_dynasty_desc: "Who better to come from the northern capital region than those of Yan? There are none so capable in terms of administration than us, and none so likely as us to seize power for the greater good that is the prosperity of the Middle Kingdom."

 after_the_tang_dynasty_desc: "The old and decaying Tang Dynasty was dying when our founder, Emperor Taizu, overthrew the last remaining parts and established the Later Liang. His actions may have brought about the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, but there was merit and there were reasons as to why he did so and we live on in the hopes that we can see his ambitions through to the end."
 ambition_for_luoyang_and_changan: "Ambition for Luoyang and Chang'an"
 ambition_for_luoyang_and_changan_desc: "The twin capitals of the Tang Dynasty were Luoyang and Chang'an.

 from_kaifeng_outwards_desc: "The foundational power for the Later Liang was at Kaifeng and Emperor Taizu and his son, Emperor Mo, attempted to cultivate it to become a place where the Later Liang could exert power from. If we put enough time and effort into making Kaifeng into just such a place where the Liang Dynasty is known as the true and legitimate holder of the Mandate of Heaven, then we will be well on our way to claiming the whole of the Middle Kingdom for ourselves."
 memories_of_the_southern_tang: "Memories of the Southern Tang"
 memories_of_the_southern_tang_desc: "Inept military measures and internal struggles became our downfall under Emperor Mo as the Southern Tang conquered our territory in its bid to reform the Tang Dynasty once more.

 help_from_the_north: "Northern Help"
 help_from_the_north_desc: "Shatuo Turks were of importance to the Later Liang due to the fact that Emperor Taizu had to maintain tense relations with them since he had a previous rivalry with Li Keyong, governor of Shanxi province. Later on though, the Shatuo Turks proved useful as military aids to various parts of the Middle Kingdom and it is that aid from the northern people that we maintain. The rivalry is gone now, and the Shatuo Turks are but distant memories, yet still a bond of mutual benefits still lingers between the Liang Dynasty and the people from the north."
 warranted_brutality: "Warranted Brutality"
 warranted_brutality_desc: "In an era of chaos and dispute claims to succession and thrones, one must be ruthless in their actions, along with being swift and mindful of the actions to come.

 foundations_from_the_zhou_desc: "The Zhou Dynasty is still looked upon with prestige in the annals of history within the Middle Kingdom, and within the Zhou Dynasty came forth the designated area where we, those of the Qin Dynasty, rose up from. Though initially meant for breeding and rasiing horses, it became the heart of our state and will continue to be for as long as we are around."
 shang_yang_promoting_legalism: "Shang Yang's Legalism"
 shang_yang_promoting_legalism_desc: "The type of legalism promoted by Shang Yang to the military and administration of the Qin Dynasty after the Zhou Dynasty fell from grace was the type that made the fighters of our state ruthless and efficient. They showed better discipline and superior tactics as compared to those around them and carried forth military innovations for years to come. It is this legacy that we of the resurgent Qin Dynasty keep to."
 developments_of_the_qin_capital: "Developments of the Qin Capital"
 developments_of_the_qin_capital_desc: "Not only did Shang Yang promote legalism to the Qin Dynasty, he also promoted the development of the capital itself through infrastructure investments.

 ready_for_military_reforms_desc: "Part of the strength of the Qin Dynasty was its capability of adopting military reforms and innovations for itself as this proved crucial in the Spring and Autumn Period that preceeded the formalization of the Qin Dynasty. This spirit of adaptation in military matters is something that we are still ready for today as new technologies come to us and our officers."
 strong_political_and_peasent_base: "Strong Political and Citizen Base"
 strong_political_and_peasent_base_desc: "Legalism was foundational to our power, but it alone could not have propelled the Qin Dynasty to prominence. It was the unity sustained in the peasant class and the political class that also helped us gain authority and power and with this unity within us once more, who knows just how much power we can exude against our rivals."
 grand_position_of_the_qin_dynasty: "Grand Position of the Qin Dynasty"
 grand_position_of_the_qin_dynasty_desc: "Thanks in part to more recent technologies, the seat of the Qin Dynasty is fit not only for horse breeding, but also agricultural yields and other resource extractions.

 migrations_of_the_hakka: "Migrations of the Hakka"
 migrations_of_the_hakka_desc: "Our origins lay in the north of where we curently reside, but constant periods of unrest have made it impossible for us to sustain life up there. Thus, we migrated over the centuries to where we reside currently, and though we lost many traditions from these migrations, we have gained crucial insight into moving lightly and with haste, something the others around us can't match in the slightest."
 productive_potential_in_the_earth: "Productive Potential"
 productive_potential_in_the_earth_desc: "There lies potential not in the agriculture of where we live, but rather in the hills and mountains. Precious metals used in various sectors of daily life, from building materials to military weapons, can be found deep within the hills which we claim as our own.

We speak a different dialect and a perform different rituals and customs that may be similar to their own, but still there are differences that set us apart and leave us vulnerable to persecution, which we have endured for ages without end. Now, though, we may finally fight back and see to it that the Hakka people are not shunned and executed for being simply who they are."
 promote_the_dragon_deities: "Promote the Dragon Deities"
 promote_the_dragon_deities_desc: "Also distinct from the other Chinese people in the Middle Kingdom, the Hakka people are fond of the dragon deities passed down from ages ago. Rarely found elsewhere, the dragon deities help strengthen our faith and worship of our ancestors and we will continue promoting them throughout our land."
 build_toulous: "Tulou, Earthen Buildings"
 build_toulous_desc: "Tulou are traditional communal buildings built by our people for generations and they serve not only as great living spaces, but also partially as defensive structures that can help stave off enemy invasions. If we build upon this mentality and work toward making some tulou into a more defensive structure, perhaps they will prove useful as fortresses in the future. Certainly no one will see these coming as only the Hakka people have built them and readily continue to build them."
 carve_out_a_place_for_the_hakka: "A Place for the Hakka"
 carve_out_a_place_for_the_hakka_desc: "The existence of the Hakka people has been one of turmoil and chaos, full of unrest and persecution from various groups in the Middle Kingdom. Will we know peace some day? Will we be able to carve out a place for ourselves to live in peace and prosperity? In a place without tension and persecution? Perhaps not anytime soon, but it is certainly something we can work toward."
 YUE_ideas: "Yue Ideas"
 YUE_ideas_start: "Yue Traditions"
 YUE_ideas_bonus: "Yue Ambition"
 resisting_central_chinese_authority: "Resisting Central Chinese Authority"
 resisting_central_chinese_authority_desc: "There is a reason why there has never been a dynasty with their capital fixed in the southern parts of the Middle Kingdom, and it is because of how resistant and distinct the south is from the north. Time and time again they have tried to rein us in, but still there is resistance and eventual autonomy given to the Yue people. Now that we are free once more, the others can be sure that they will not have an easy time taking us back into the fold."
 the_legacy_of_goujian_against_wu: "The Legacy of Goujian against Wu"
 the_legacy_of_goujian_against_wu_desc: "One of our most famous kings, Goujian, destroyed and annexed the petty state of Wu in 473BC and set an example of just how powerful the southern people of the Middle Kingdom can be. It is partially because of his example that we continue to try to be ready militarily for whatever comes our way, lest we fail and succumb to foreign incursions or internal decadance."
 keepers_of_the_southern_waters: "Keepers of the Southern Waters"
 keepers_of_the_southern_waters_desc: "The waters in the south of the Middle Kingdom are rife with trade from far off places that hold several different goods and resources unique as compared to what is found locally. We must protect these trade routes and water ways from those further north so that the prosperity comes solely to us, and once that is established, naval dominance is a mere small step away."
 connections_to_the_vietnamese: "Connections to the Viet People"
 connections_to_the_vietnamese_desc: "The Yue people are connected to the Viet people in at least some tangential fashion and this is evident through our history that dates back to the Nanyue Kingdom. By building relations with the Viet people and cultivating prosperous ties with key Viet officials, we can begin to bridge the gap betweent he two people groups and once again fight against the hegemony attempting to be imposed on from the north."
 blending_han_and_yue_administrations_together: "Blending of Administrations"
 blending_han_and_yue_administrations_together_desc: "The traditional administative structure of the Middle Kingdom was something foreign to the Yue people before, but as the Nanyue Kingdom became more closely tied to the Han Dynasty, the administration of both became slowly intertwined. By cultivating this blending of administrative methods more and taking the best of both sides, we can effectively govern the Yue people and state through both reformist and traditionalist methods."
 the_great_nanyue_kingdom: "The Great Nanyue Kingdom"
 the_great_nanyue_kingdom_desc: "Though seemingly gone from the memory of many, the Nanyue Kingdom is still around in the hearts and minds of several Yue people. Our descent from it to today is miraculous and intriguing to say the least, but now that there is again an independent Yue state, there can finally be a proper and legitimate successor to the kingdom of old."
 MIN_ideas: "Min Ideas"
 MIN_ideas_start: "Min Traditions"
 MIN_ideas_bonus: "Min Ambition"
 minister_of_the_south: "Minister of the South"
 minister_of_the_south_desc: "In the midst of the collapsing Tang Dynasty, Wang Shenzhi was the military leader in the are of what we hold true as the land of the Min. Upon his son's ascension to the throne, Wang Yanzheng, he proclaimed himself 'Emperor of Min' in 933 and with the proclamation done, the development of the Min domain began in earnest."
 maritime_investments: "Maritime Investments"
 maritime_investments_desc: "The position of the Min domain is such that maritime affairs are unavoidable. Instead of doing so, we will engage with maritime trade and warfare and seek to dominate it; if we can secure the coastal waters around the Middle Kingdom for ourselves, we will have a much easier time promoting and forcing our access to the interior."
 discard_the_memory_of_the_yin_dynasty: "Discard the Yin Dynasty"
 discard_the_memory_of_the_yin_dynasty_desc: "One of the sons of Wang Shenzhi rebelled against him and proclaimed himself the 'Yin Dynasty', a bitter memory in which we are eager to stamp out entirely. It brought great disunity to the Min people; we simply can't let it happen again in any shape or form, for a united Min is what is needed, not a divided one."
 cultivate_the_min_domain: "Cultivate the Min Domain"
 cultivate_the_min_domain_desc: "Though not the easiest land to develop for productive or agricultural uses, the Min domain is capable of becoming prosperous if time and effort are put into it. Seeing as it is our heartland where most of our people live, why shouldn't we develop it?"
 succeed_where_we_failed_southern_tang: "Succeed where we Failed"
 succeed_where_we_failed_southern_tang_desc: "The Southern Tang took advantage of the disunity within the Min Kingdom and our allegiance to Wuyue was not able to hold off the onslaught of the Southern Tang. We must learn from the lessons in warfare they taught us and curate a better and more robust military, starting from the core of things: the infantry."
 out_of_isolation: "Out of Isolation"
 out_of_isolation_desc: "The trade routes through the coastal waters may seem to be a good way at getting us out of isolation, but in truth they only get us contacts, not formal relations. We must bring ourselves truly out of isolation from the southern reaches and into a new age of outreach and diplomacy if we hope to survive and thrive."
 zhongguo: "Zhongguo, the Middle Kingdom"
 zhongguo_desc: "A united Middle Kingdom is but a dream to many. Several dynasties have seen the light of day, and then been drowned out by one cause or another. Will we be yet another dynasty that rises and falls? No, we must not let ourselves think in such a negative way. The march toward the end, toward unification and grandeur, is upon us; we will see the end of this era of division and proclaim a new dynasty for the Chinese people, but first, we must step through the fires that lay ahead of us."

 original_people_of_guangxi: "Original People of Guangxi"
 original_people_of_guangxi_desc: "Of the southwestern part of the Middle Kingdom, where the jungles and hills meet the unforgiving terrain of the Thai, Lao, and Viet people, the Zhuang people lived on. Many find it hard to live here like we have, and those who dare intrude on our land with hostile intent will be like those who have tried before: dying on the ground, crawling against the Zhuang people."
 tenuous_chinese_authority: "Tenuous Chinese Authority"
 tenuous_chinese_authority_desc: "We find ourselves far from any firm authority from the Middle Kingdom itself. Nanjing, the supposed 'southern capital' is so far from us that rarely any Zhuang people have travelled to and from it, recounting it for our people in depth. With this in mind, we are often left to ourselves and governing our land in the ways we have cultivated over the centuries is much better when compared to top-down laws of force by the Chinese from afar."
 remember_the_nanzhao: "Remember the Kingdom of Nanzhao"
 remember_the_nanzhao_desc: "The Tai people and their great kingdom of Nanzhao was something to behold. The Zhuang people looked up to them as they repelled armies from the Chinese in 751 and 754, but we could not do the same, unfortunately. Still, their example of unity amidst the onslaught of Chinese forces glows brightly as an example for our people to follow."
 warrior_women_of_the_zhuang: "Warrior Women of the Zhuang"
 warrior_women_of_the_zhuang_desc: "Unlike other cultures around us, we, the Zhuang, see women as a resource almost as valuable as men in regards to fighting. We train many women in similar ways in which we train men in regards to military matters and as such they are able to earn a better place amongst the clans of the Zhuang people."
 rid_ourselves_of_tribal_complexes: "Ridding ourselves of Tribalism"
 rid_ourselves_of_tribal_complexes_desc: "Perhaps it is a reason as to why our people are so weak at promoting influence beyond Guangxi; tribes and clans from around the area we inhabit are always keen on gaining or usurping power from the others, but anytime this happens, great feuds erupt and atrocities are witnessed that should never happen. It is because of these past experiences that we must learn to transcend them and break the ties that bind us to the tribal networks of the past. It will be tough to do so, but it will be well worth the effort."
 retain_and_refine_shogongism_moism: "Refine Moism"
 retain_and_refine_shogongism_moism_desc: "The traditional religious practices of the Zhuang people are strange when compared to the Buddhists to the south, or the Confucians in the rest of the Middle Kingdom. Though we have adopted some practices from both regions, Moism is still prevalent in Zhuang society and with it being foundational for our people, there is a sense that it must be refined and cultivated as time goes on. If we do this and actively work to help reform it into a state religion, the Zhuang people may seen unity on yet another level crucial for sustaining a prospering state."
 peace_for_the_zhuang_people: "Peace for the Zhuang People"
 peace_for_the_zhuang_people_desc: "Though some of our people have lofty ambitions for a great empire spanning to the horizons in all directions, the majority of Zhuang people simply want peace in their lives, free from the authorities from the Middle Kingdom and free from dangers elsewhere. It is this goal that we must work toward, and a peaceful existence that the Zhuang people look forward to in the ever-changing world at large."

 field_experience_of_wu_sangui: "Field Experience of Wu Sangui"
 field_experience_of_wu_sangui_desc: "Wu Sangui was the one in charge of suppressing and consolidating the southwestern portion of China after the Manchus of the north swept through the Ming Dynasty. It is with his leadership and experience in the field of battle as general under the Ming Dynasty that we march forth against those who would oppose our authority."
 intimate_knowledge_of_china: "Intimate Knowledge of China"
 intimate_knowledge_of_china_desc: "Because of Wu Sangui's experience that he brought with him, the people in the Zhou administration have extensive knowledge of China's layout, its major roads, its major cities, just about everything there is to know for now. Going forth, we should use this knowledge to our advantage when dealing with both warring states in China and also those who want to strike up deals with us in the future."
 opportunity_at_every_turn: "Opportunity at Every Turn"
 opportunity_at_every_turn_desc: "Like our founders opportunistic self, the administration and diplomatic arm of Zhou must be ready for opportunities at a mere moments notice. Being flexible in this regard will be key to how we survive and thrive in not only China, but on the greater world stage."
 consolidate_the_southwest: "Consolidate the Southwest"
 consolidate_the_southwest_desc: "The hilly and tropical terrain of Southwest China has historically been hard to control because of the various tribes and clans that live here. The Yi and Miao may be the largest cultural groups, but many other smaller minorites exist that we will need to accomadate in some manner if we ever seek to consolidate true authority in the region."
 reinforce_supply_routes: "Reinforce Supply Routes"
 reinforce_supply_routes_desc: "What our home region has taught us is that supply routes are absolutely crucial to fielding any sort of military force. Proper depots, ammunition storage, food reserves, everything that encompasses 'logistics' needs to be taken care of to the greatest possible degree in Zhou for future campaigns."
 suppress_tribal_sentiment: "Suppress Tribal Sentiment"
 suppress_tribal_sentiment_desc: "The tribes and clans of the southwest, though pacified to a degree, are not always happy with our administration or they have disputes of there own that boil over into great bouts of conflict inside our own territory. We must mediate and suppress these rebellious sentiment through both civil means, and military means if things eventually come to that."
 rise_of_the_great_zhou: "Rise of the Great Zhou"
 rise_of_the_great_zhou_desc: "With the fall of the Ming Dynasty and the shattering of all that was once whole and united in the Middle Kingdom, the ashes have tried to reform themselves, rising up and reaching for the throne they want, but collapsing as their fingers near the radiant glow of it. Let the rising of the Great Zhou Dynasty be the first to firmly hold on to the throne that the Ming Dynasty left vacant, and let our valor and effort light the path to victory!"
